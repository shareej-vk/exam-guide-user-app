The player has a mixture of two miscible liquids with different boiling points, e.g., acetone (56°C) and water (100°C). The player heats the flask. A thermometer shows the temperature rising. At 56°C, the temperature holds steady as the acetone boils, turns to vapor, travels through the condenser (where it turns back to liquid), and collects in a separate beaker. Once all the acetone is distilled, the temperature begins to rise again towards 100°C. The player has successfully separated the liquids.",
